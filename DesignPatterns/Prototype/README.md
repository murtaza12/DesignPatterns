# Prototype Design Pattern with Unit Testing

## Overview

The **Prototype** design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to clone existing objects without relying on their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is expensive or complex, enabling the reuse of existing objects.

This example demonstrates two types of Prototype implementations:
1. **Shallow Copy**
2. **Deep Copy**

Each implementation shows how objects can be cloned with varying levels of depth.

## Types of Prototype Implementations

### 1. **Shallow Copy**

In a shallow copy, only the top-level fields of an object are copied. References to nested objects are shared between the original and the copy.

- **Pros**: Fast and memory-efficient.
- **Cons**: Changes to nested objects affect both the original and the copy.

### 2. **Deep Copy**

In a deep copy, the object and all of its nested objects are copied. The original and the copy are entirely independent.

- **Pros**: Ensures complete independence between the original and the copy.
- **Cons**: More complex and potentially slower.

## Use Case of Prototype Design Pattern

### 1. **Copying Configuration Settings**
When working with application settings, the Prototype pattern can create variations of a base configuration without modifying the original.

### 2. **Game Development**
In games, you can clone objects (e.g., characters, enemies) with similar properties, reducing object creation overhead.

### 3. **Prototyping**
Quickly create new objects based on a template object for prototyping purposes.

## Design Pattern Benefits

- **Efficient Object Creation**: Avoids the cost of creating and initializing new instances from scratch.
- **Flexible and Reusable**: Allows the reuse of existing objects as prototypes.
- **Customizable Cloning**: Supports both shallow and deep cloning, depending on requirements.

## Unit Testing

### Purpose
Unit tests validate the behavior of Prototype implementations to ensure:
- Correct object cloning.
- Independence (or sharing) of nested objects, depending on the type of prototype.

### Test Cases

1. **Shallow Copy Tests**:
   - Verify that the top-level object is copied.
   - Confirm that nested objects share the same reference.

2. **Deep Copy Tests**:
   - Ensure that the top-level object is copied.
   - Confirm that nested objects are cloned and independent.

## Conclusion

The Prototype pattern is a powerful creational pattern that simplifies object creation. By implementing both shallow and deep copy prototypes, this example demonstrates how to leverage the Prototype pattern for efficient and flexible object cloning.
